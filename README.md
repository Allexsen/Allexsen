# Hola 👋

💼 ex-Huawei AI/ML Researcher intern, Summer '25 Google Intern [no more, TRC issues].  
💻 I am passionate about software development, optimization, algorithms, research, etc.  
🌱 I do a lot of different stuff, some minor, some major, some not related at all :D  
💬 Ask me about anything - I am happy to help as much as I can!
